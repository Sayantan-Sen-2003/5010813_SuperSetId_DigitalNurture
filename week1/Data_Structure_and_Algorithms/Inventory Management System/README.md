Exercise 1: Inventory Management System

# Why Data Structures and Algorithms are Essential in Handling Large Inventories:

- Efficient data structures and algorithms are crucial in handling large inventories for several reasons:

- Performance: Proper data structures allow for efficient access, modification, and storage of inventory data, reducing the time complexity of operations like searching, adding, and deleting products.
- Scalability: As the inventory grows, efficient data structures ensure that the system can handle increased load without significant performance degradation.
- Memory Management: Efficient data structures optimize memory usage, which is essential when dealing with large amounts of data.
- Data Integrity: Proper algorithms ensure that data operations maintain the integrity and consistency of the inventory data.
 
# Types of Data Structures Suitable for Inventory Management:

- ArrayList: Useful for scenarios where the number of products is relatively small, and there are frequent retrieval and update operations. However, it has limitations in terms of search and delete operations due to its O(n) complexity.
- HashMap: Suitable for larger inventories where quick access, insertion, and deletion of products are required. It offers average-case O(1) time complexity for these operations.
- TreeMap: If the products need to be maintained in a sorted order, a TreeMap (or any balanced binary search tree like AVL or Red-Black Tree) can be used, which offers O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations


# Analysis:
Time Complexity Analysis:

- Add Product:
Using HashMap.put(), the average-case time complexity is O(1).
- Update Product:
Using HashMap.put(), the average-case time complexity is O(1).
- Delete Product:
Using HashMap.remove(), the average-case time complexity is O(1).
- Get Product:
Using HashMap.get(), the average-case time complexity is O(1).
# Optimizing Operations:

- Collision Handling: In a HashMap, collisions are handled by chaining (linked lists) or open addressing (probing). Ensure a good hash function to minimize collisions and maintain O(1) complexity.
- Load Factor: Adjust the load factor and initial capacity of the HashMap to reduce the need for resizing and rehashing operations, which can be costly.
- Concurrency: If the inventory system is to be used in a multi-threaded environment, consider using ConcurrentHashMap to handle concurrent access and modification of the inventory.
