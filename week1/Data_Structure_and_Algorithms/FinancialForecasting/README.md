# Concept of Recursion:

Definition: 
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It typically involves a base case (which terminates the recursion) and a recursive case (which breaks the problem into smaller subproblems).

Example Use Case: Calculating factorials, Fibonacci numbers, or traversing hierarchical structures.


# Recursive Algorithm to Predict Future Values:

Let's assume the formula for future value 

FV after n years with an initial amount P and an annual growth rate r is:

ùêπùëâ=P√ó [(1+ùëü)^ùëõ];

We can implement this using recursion to compute the future value.

 Complexity Analysis:

Recursive Algorithm:
Each recursive call reduces the number of years by 1, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where 
n is the number of years. This is because the function performs  n recursive calls.


# Optimization:

To avoid excessive computation and improve efficiency, especially with larger datasets or more complex calculations, consider the following optimizations:

- Memoization (Dynamic Programming approach): Store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. For financial forecasting, this may not be as critical since each year‚Äôs calculation is straightforward, but in more complex recursive problems, memoization can significantly reduce computation.

- Iteration: For this particular problem, an iterative approach may be more efficient. Using a loop to calculate the future value avoids the overhead of recursive function calls
